This dns server is NOT production ready !!!

The idea is to develop a scalable DNS server in scala and netty, which emulates route 53 features like:

- wighted round robin
- alias record
- nice graphic interface
- scalable


additionally the server should support the definition of CNAMEs round robin or a mix between CNAMEs and IP address
