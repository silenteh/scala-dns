This dns server is NOT production ready !!!

The idea is to develop a scalable DNS server in scala and netty, which emulates route 53 features like:

- wighted round robin
- alias record
- nice graphic interface
- scalable


additionally the server should support the definition of CNAMEs round robin or a mix between CNAMEs and IP address

TEMP: 
in order to test it on osx:

sudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,5353 tcp from any to any 53 in
sudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,5353 udp from any to any 53 in


to remove the rule

sudo ipfw flush

or

sudo ipfw remove 100
